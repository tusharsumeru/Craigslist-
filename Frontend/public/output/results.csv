The members web store being marketed offers a lifetime membership benefits plan like no other. Membership packages are available now for $199.00 + tax and are limited.

Although our business relates to the recreational marijuana market, our members web store based in Erie, Pennsylvania that’s being marketed does “not” sell any marijuana products or any other products regulated by the state of Pennsylvania.

As our business model is designed to license new stores in legal recreational marijuana markets and is in licensing processes in several states, all future recreational marijuana stores will be separate entities from our members web store based here in Erie, Pennsylvania.

This is a cannabis related business so if you don’t smoke marijuana, (and it’s certainly not a job qualification lol), you will be guilty by association. Be sure this business is a fit for you before applying.

Back to the position, our brand new corporation needs a marketing director who can take our business to the national level in the very near future! This is our interview process;

Share the membership store website and keep track of post hits as well as keeping up with reply’s. Our corporation is transparent and non-political! Any political responses supporting any political party to your posts should be ignored. Our company will “not” engage in politics or respond to any negative posts. Anyone engaging in this activity will immediately be disqualified for this job offer. Our company is all inclusive and LGBTQ friendly. Keep it clean out there, we’re a respectful community of professionals.

How to apply? Email our corporate team updates on how many postings you posted along with links to the posts. That’s it! We don’t care who you are as long as you’re keeping it clean and are good at marketing our business! Think it’s for you? Be aware, this job will require marketing recreational marijuana stores and products while traveling around the country. So again, be sure this job is a fit for you. If so, for now, show us what you got, we’ll be here to support you! Interested candidates need to reply to this ad with your email and a brief summary of why you’re a good fit for this job and what you can bring to our company. The corporate team would love to hear from you! Email today and start posting immediately!",Not Specified,"56e99115d82d30e0acb68331c143362d
